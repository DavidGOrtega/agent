# Stately Agent

Stately Agent is a flexible framework for building AI agents using state machines. Stately agents go beyond normal LLM-based AI agents by:

- Using state machines to guide the agent's behavior, powered by [XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate)
- Incorporating **observations**, **message history**, and **feedback** to the agent decision-making and text-generation processes, as needed
- Enabling custom **planning** abilities for agents to achieve specific goals based on state machine logic, observations, and feedback
- Wrapping the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) to easily support multiple model providers, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq, Perplexity, and more
